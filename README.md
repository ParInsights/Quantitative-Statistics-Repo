# Quantitative-Statistics-Repo
Repo of Quant Stats Work


The work completed in this repo shows an understanding of contemporary methods of statistical inference regardless of the specific type of analysis you are undertaking. My primary goal was to learn the techniques and concepts that facilitate drawing sensible conclusions from samples of quantitative data. This repo will show the following three concepts:
 
1. Demonstrate knowledge of contemporary inferential statistical concepts (from the perspective of two contemporary philosophies) and data analysis strategies by making sensible choices about:
• How data collection, the data themselves, and the analysis processes relate to the kinds of inferences that can be drawn
• What kinds of analysis will be feasible and developing the skill of planning data collection and measurement to facilitate appropriate analysis

2. Practice effective data science analytics:
• Preparing data for analysis, including screening data, dealing with missing data,
doing data transformations
• Testing assumptions that data must meet for analyses and inferences to be
reasonable
• Interpreting data analysis results and outputs and communicating them to others
using language that accurately describes uncertainty
• Leaving a documentation/provenance trail for other analysts to follow and reproduce your work
 
3. Demonstrate competence and/or mastery of the skills needed for use of a popular statistics and data management platform to conduct sound and reproducible analyses including:
• Installing R and R-studio, and creating readable code to conduct analyses
• Exploring the limitations of existing data sets and how their provenance
influences what analyses to perform and what inferences to draw
• Choosing appropriate R procedures and configuring the relevant operational
parameters
